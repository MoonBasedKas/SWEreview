\section{Intro to SWE}
\begin{enumerate}
      \item What is engineering?
            The creative application of scientific prinicples to design or develop structures.\\

      \item What is software Engineering?
            The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the developement, operation and maintenance of software, and the study of these approaches.
            (or without the yap: the application of engineering to software).\\

      \item What factors affect SW quality.\\
            Complexity and change.\\

      \item How does complexity affect quality?.\\
            When a system becomes so complex a singular programmer can no longer understand it.\\

      \item How does change affect quality?\\
            The entropy of a software system increases with each change. Each implemented change erodes at the structure of the system. Making the next change more expensive. As time goes on
            the cost of implementing changes will increase.

      \item What are the methods of dealing with complexity?
            Abstraction, Decomposition, and hierarchy.

      \item What are the ways of abstracting through modeling?\\
            System mode, Task model, and Issue model.\\

      \item Give an exmaple of a System model and what it does.\\
            Object model: What is the struct of the system.\\
            Functional Model: What are the functions of the system and how does data flow through the system.\\
            Dynamic Model: How does the system react to external events.\\

      \item give an example of a task model and what it does.\\
            Gantt/PERT chart: What are the dependecies between each task.\\
            Schedule: How can this be done within a time limit.\\
            Org Chart: What are the roles in the project.\\

      \item What is an issues model?\\
            What are the open and closed issues. What constraints were posed by the client? What resolutions were made?\\

      \item What is decomposition?\\
            A technique used to master complexity (divide and conquer type stuff).\\

      \item What are each of the types of decomposition?\\
            Functional decomposition and Object-oriented decomposition.\\

      \item What is hierarchy.\\

\section{Lifecycles}
\begin{enumerate}
      \item What is a Software developement Life cycle?

      \item What was the first life cycle?\\
            Waterfall model (wooo)\\

      \item What are the benefits of the waterfall model?\\
            Nice milestones, No need to look back, one activity at a time, and easy to check progress.\\

      \item what are thecons of a waterfall model?\\
            Software developement tends to not be linear and you'll need to go back and refine.\\

      \item When should one use a prototyping model?\\
            When user requirements are unclear. For systems with high emphasis on the UI and require a high degree of user interaction.\\

      \item What are the pros of a prototype model?
            Iterative process, frequent feedback, fast.\\

      \item What are the cons of a prototype model?\\
            Design compromise frequently due to time constraints, customer could think it's a real product. Lack of robustness and completeness and at the end of each iteration we have a prototype.\\

      \item what are the two types of prototype and describe them.\\
            Functional prototype: implement and deliever an operational system with minimum funcftionally and build from there.\\
            Exploratory prototype: Implement part oft he system to learn more about the requirements.\\
            Revolutionary prototyping: Get user expierence with a throwaway version to get the requirements right then build the whole system\\
            Evolutionary Prototyping: Used as the basis for the implementation of the final system.\\

      \item What is the disadvantage of evolutionary prototyping?\\
            Can only be used if target system can be constructed in a prototyping language.\\

      \item What is the spiral model?
            Use a waterfall model for each prototype developement (a cycle). If risk has been resolved evaluate the results of the cycle and plan for the next. If you run into an unsolvable
            product terminate (give up all roads leave to doom).\\

      \item what are the advantages of a spiral model?
            \\ Model runs through the entire lifecycle of software and is iterative.\\

      \item what are the disadvantages?\\
            Difficult to convince customers the process is easily manageable. Project length cannot be determined.\\

      \item When is a SW developement process considred mature?\\
            If the develpement activites are well defined and if management has some control over the quality, budget, and Schedule in the project.\\

      \item what are the 5 maturity levels?\\
            Initial Level (ad hoc/chaotic)\\
            Repeatable level the process depends on individuals called champions.\\
            Defined level the process is institutionalized (sanctioned by management).\\
            MAnaged level activties are measured and provide feeback for resource allocation however the process is not changing.\\
            Optimizing level process allows feedback of information to change the process itself.\\

      \item What is agile based on.\\
            It is difficult to predict in advance which requiprements or customer priorities will change.\\
            For many types of software design and construction activities are interleaved.\\
            Analysis, design, and testing are not as predictable from a planning perspective.\\

      \item Whatare the principles of agile?\\
            Highest priority is to satisfy the customer with early and continous deliever of valuable software.\\
            Welcome changing requirements anywhere in development.\\
            Delievering software frequently with a preference for shorter delievery schedules\\
            Business people and developers must work togheter daily\\
            Face-to-face communcation is the most effective method of conveying informaiotn within the developement team.\\

      \item What is DevOps?\\
            The union of people, process, and products to enable continous delievery of value to end users.\\

            Black-Box testing and White-box testing.\\

      \item Is it possible to completely test any abritary system?\\

      \item What are the 4 testing steps?\\
            Select what needs to be measured, Decide how the testing is done, develop test cases, and create a test oracle.


      \item What is a test oracle?\\
            The set of predicted results for a set of test cases. It must be written down before the testing occurs.\\

      \item What is unit testing?\\
            The testing of a unit. (Quite helpful I guess...)\\

      \item What is a unit?
            A module or a small set of modules. A few examples, classes or interfaces.\\

      \item Why bother with unit testing?\\
            It's practical and allows a divide-and-conquer approach. Splitting systems into units is very helpful and narrow down where bugs are. You don't want to chase down bugs in other units. Support regresion testing
            allows you to make changes to code and know if you broke something. Improves confidence that changing one many things doesn't break everything (yay!).\\

      \item How can one do unit testing?\\
            Build systems in layers. Then test upwards. Start with classes that don't depend on others and countinue testing building on already tested classes.

      \item Benefits of unit testing?
            Avoid having to write stubs. When testing a module it depends on verified reliable modules.\\

      \item What are some unit testing Heurisitcs?\\
            Create unit tests as soon as object design is completed. Develop the test cases. Cross-check the test cases to eliminate duplicats. Desk check your source code. Create a test harness. Execute the test cases. Compare the results
            of the test with your orcale.\\

      \item What are the parts of test code?
            \\ The test fixture, test driver, and test oracle.\\
      \item What is the test driver?\\
            The class that runs the tests.\\

      \item What is the test fixture?\\
            Set of variables used in testing.\\

      \item What is the intergration testing strategy?\\
            The entire system is viewed as a collection of subsystems. Note: The order which subsystems are selected for testing and intergration determines the specific strategy.\\


      \item What is system testing?\\
            Ensure that the complete system compiles with the functional and nonfunctional requirements.\\
            Functional testing, Perforamnce testing, Acceptance testing, and installation testing are all different types of system testing.\\

      \item What is the impact of requirements on system testing?\\
            The more explicit the measurements the easier they are to test. Quality of use cases determines ease of functional testing. Quality of subsystem determines the ease of structure testing.
            Quality of nonfunctional requirements and constraints determine the ease of perforamnce tests.\\

            When you introduce small changes tot he program and find tests that cause the mutant programs to fail. Failure is determined by a different output from the original program. Check the output of useful tests on the original program.\\

      \item What is Model-Based testing.\\
            Derives tests from a model that describes some aspects of the system under a test. Model describes part of the behavior.\\

            (simple version Test requirements contain each reachable node in G.)\\

      \item What is edge coverage?\\
            A slightly stronger system than node coverage. Test requirements contain each reachable path of length up to 1, inclusive, in G.\\
            Length up to 1 allows graphs with one and no edges.\\

      \item When are Node coveage and edge coverage difference?\\
            When there is an edge and another subpath between a pair of nodes.\\
            Node coverage TR = $\{0 ,1 ,2\}$.\\
            Test path = $[0 , 1, 2]$.\\
            Edge coverage TR $= \{0, 1, 2\}$.\\

      \item What is complete path coverage and where does it fail?\\
            Test requirements contain all paths in G. It fails whenever the program introduces a loop. Infiniately many TR paths arrise unfornately (might be solvable with the infinite monkey theorem assuming you have infinite monkeys...).\\

      \item What is a control flow graph.\\
            Modles all executions of a method by describing control structures. Made of nodes statements or sequences of statements, Edges transfers of control, and basic block a sequence of statements
